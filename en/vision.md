## How is Affekt structured?
In the background, we have been building a professional database structure for more than 5 years to ensure that all data can be stored in the best condition. Due to the technical structure we have made the following advantages possible:
- Avoidance of duplicates
- Secure backups and snapshots of all data at daily intervals
- All-In-One-Place
    - Easy export options
    - Taking the data to other systems
    - API interface, for own queries
