## What is Playlist Exchange ?

**AFFEKT Playlist Exchange** is an exchange network of playlist owners for streaming platforms. First we set up a Spotify uplink. The app makes it easy to pitch the tracks in your playlists to other playlists.

Be part of a huge network of curators and promote your tracks to successful Spotify playlists.

This way you increase the organic range of your tracks, increase the number of your followers and promote commitment.

## Dashboard

The Playlist Exchange **Dashboard** shows you on the left side under **Submissions received** an overview of all submissions which you have already received.

On the right side you will find under **My Submissions** the status of all tracks you have submitted to other playlists.

Under **Playlist Followers** you can see the increase of your followers of all your public playlists as statistics.
