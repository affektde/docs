## What are labels?
Under **Labels** you create your Record Label settings like **Label Name**, **Release Catalog Prefix** and **Track Catalog Prefix**.

Here you also have an overview of all your labels you run with Affekt Audio Management and can easily filter by name, release catalog and track catalog.
