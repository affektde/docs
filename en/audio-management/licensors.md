## What are licensors?
Under **Licensors** you can create and edit both  **Artists** and **Contributors**.


Add your artist or contributor to an account under **EDIT** and enter all relevant data like name, display name, homepage link, social media accounts, and a biography.

You can also upload a profile photo here and create and configure your own **Artist Website**.

Your **Artist Website** offers the possibility to upload a separate logo and more pictures as well as the function to show your mix cloud links and to add categories like "biography", "next events" and "videos".

Under **New Documents** you can store all artist or contributor related documents like "Technical Rider", Profile PDF's, Logos and Artists photos or receipts. So you have all your data in one place at any time.
