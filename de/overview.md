- Difference between CLASSIC and NEXT

## Difference between CLASSIC and NEXT
CLASSIC is our first stable version of an audio management system that has been successfully used and developed by many labels from Munich over the last 5 years. With the NEXT version we want to give the whole thing a new modern look. Playlist Exchange was designed in NEXT and the audio management services will gradually be integrated into the NEXT version.

> {info} If you want to use Audio Management, please go to the CLASSIC version. This version is currently stable and offers you the full range of services.
